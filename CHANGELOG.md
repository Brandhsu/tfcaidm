## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.0a5] - 2021-12-24

### Added

- Add model benchmarking to the caidm clusters, site available at [tfcaidm-site](https://brandhsu.github.io/tfcaidm-site/)
- Add helper functions in [tfcaidm.model](https://github.com/Brandhsu/tfcaidm/blob/master/tfcaidm/models/model.py) for streamlined model inference

### Deprecated

- Deprecated method `create_generator` in [tfcaidm.JClient](https://github.com/Brandhsu/tfcaidm/blob/master/tfcaidm/data/jclient.py) in favor of distinct generators for training (`model.fit`) and model evaluation (`model.eval`). These methods are now called `train_generator` and `eval_generator`, for any projects `@overloading create_generator` please make the necessary project changes. The default behavior of `eval_generator` is the same as `train_generator`.
